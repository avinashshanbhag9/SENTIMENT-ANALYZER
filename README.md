Sentiment Analyzer
A machine learning-based web application that predicts the sentiment (Positive, Negative, Neutral) of user input text. The project is built using Python (scikit-learn) for ML and Flask for the web interface. It is trained on a real-world Twitter sentiment dataset.

üöÄ Features
Real-time sentiment prediction from user text input.

Trained on Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset.

Achieves 76% accuracy with Logistic Regression & TF-IDF.

Responsive web interface built using Flask + HTML/CSS.

Clean folder structure and easy to execute.

üõ† Tech Stack
Python 3

scikit-learn, pandas, numpy

Flask (Backend)

HTML, CSS, Bootstrap (Frontend)

Pickle for saving ML models
